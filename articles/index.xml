      <description>I read an interesting article this morning from an interview with Hilary Mason on Harvard Business Review about How AI fits into your data science team.

      <description>Rachel Thomas wrote a really good summary piece about structuring your Data Science and Engineering teams that I think a lot of people will recognise aspects of in their organisations.

class Door: colour = &#39;brown&#39; def __init__(self, number, status): self.number = number self.status = status @classmethod def knock(cls): print(&amp;quot;Knock!&amp;quot;) @classmethod def paint(cls, colour): cls.colour = colour def open(self): self.status = &#39;open&#39; def close(self): self.status = &#39;closed&#39;   The paint() class method now changes the class attribute colour which is shared amongst instances.</description>
