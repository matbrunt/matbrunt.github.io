      <description>I read an interesting article this morning from an interview with Hilary Mason on Harvard Business Review about How AI fits into your data science team.
There are a few sections I wanted to capture and expand upon, as I think analytics / data science / machine learning will all see an increase in adoption from business over the coming years, and am very interested in how this might play out.</description>

      <title>Visualising Classification Performance with ROC and AUC</title>

      <description>The Receiving Operating Characteristic, or ROC, is a way to visualise the performance of a binary classifier (0/1).
It compares the rate at which your classifier is making correct predictions (True Positives or TP) and the rate at which your classifier is making false alarms (False Positives or FP).
When evaluating a new model performance, accuracy can be very sensitive to unbalanced class proportions. The ROC curve is insensitive to this lack of balance in the data set.</description>
