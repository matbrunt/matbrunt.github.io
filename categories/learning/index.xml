      <description>There are so many open data sets out there, this is a great time to be interested in data science.
As I talked about in my earlier post about Building a data science learning plan, over the next six months I plan on working through a number of personal projects as a vehicle to apply my learnings in data science. Having a physical output as well is useful as a way of showing progress which will motivate me even more, and learning by doing has always worked well for me to pick up new knowledge.</description>

      <description>Recently I got some disappointing news that my employers are only looking to hire experienced Data Scientists, and not internally develop staff.
The positive side to this however is it has spurred me on to build a loose study framework for the next six months, which using feedback from my peers is going to diverge slightly how I was approaching building knowledge.
Previously on&amp;hellip; Until recently I focused on learning techniques such as cleaning your data, feature engineering, and creating a starting list of algorithms to build upon in a problem space.</description>
