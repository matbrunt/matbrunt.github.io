      <description>I type the way I talk, which results in my emails being overly verbose and hard to distinguish the signal I wish to convey amongst all the noise.
Do that enough times and I suspect normal human behaviour would be to no longer read lengthy emails and instead skim them, which means the message I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get across is no longer effective, and worse still, I am potentially wasting the time of every recipient.</description>
