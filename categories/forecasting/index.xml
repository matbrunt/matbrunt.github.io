      <description>&amp;ldquo;Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.&amp;rdquo; George Box.
 Forecasts are not predictions; predictions are authorative, a statement of the future based on insights into how the world works. A forecast is a projection based on assumptions about the future state of the world. It can be, and sometimes should be, wrong. However a good forecast will be useful at the point in time it is created, to highlight the direction you are heading in and drive actions in response.</description>
