      <description>&amp;ldquo;Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.&amp;rdquo; George Box.
 Forecasts are not predictions; predictions are authorative, a statement of the future based on insights into how the world works. A forecast is a projection based on assumptions about the future state of the world. It can be, and sometimes should be, wrong. However a good forecast will be useful at the point in time it is created, to highlight the direction you are heading in and drive actions in response.</description>

      <title>Writing Concise Emails</title>

      <description>I type the way I talk, which results in my emails being overly verbose and hard to distinguish the signal I wish to convey amongst all the noise.
Do that enough times and I suspect normal human behaviour would be to no longer read lengthy emails and instead skim them, which means the message I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get across is no longer effective, and worse still, I am potentially wasting the time of every recipient.</description>

      <description>There are so many open data sets out there, this is a great time to be interested in data science.
As I talked about in my earlier post about Building a data science learning plan, over the next six months I plan on working through a number of personal projects as a vehicle to apply my learnings in data science. Having a physical output as well is useful as a way of showing progress which will motivate me even more, and learning by doing has always worked well for me to pick up new knowledge.</description>

      <description>Recently I got some disappointing news that my employers are only looking to hire experienced Data Scientists, and not internally develop staff.
The positive side to this however is it has spurred me on to build a loose study framework for the next six months, which using feedback from my peers is going to diverge slightly how I was approaching building knowledge.
Previously on&amp;hellip; Until recently I focused on learning techniques such as cleaning your data, feature engineering, and creating a starting list of algorithms to build upon in a problem space.</description>

      <title>Visualising Classification Performance with ROC and AUC</title>

      <description>The Receiving Operating Characteristic, or ROC, is a way to visualise the performance of a binary classifier (0/1).
It compares the rate at which your classifier is making correct predictions (True Positives or TP) and the rate at which your classifier is making false alarms (False Positives or FP).
When evaluating a new model performance, accuracy can be very sensitive to unbalanced class proportions. The ROC curve is insensitive to this lack of balance in the data set.</description>
