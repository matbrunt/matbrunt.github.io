[{"content":"Summary # A review of my perception of \u0026ldquo;An Elegant Puzzle\u0026rdquo; by Will Larson. Considers where and how I might apply its learnings, and whether I feel I could get suitable use from the book at this present time.\nWhere Could I Use It? # The book covers a number of different areas roughly aligned around growing and supporting your team, selling your vision for the teams work, planning and collaborating with others when executing on that vision.\nManagement: protecting and advancing the team # Engineering pain points once fundamentals are in place How do we grow seniority evenly across the team Handling disagreements on velocity and prioritisation Reducing burnout by resetting broken systems rather than working harder Tracking career transitions and plateaus Strategy: planning and building support # Setting good strategies for the team Making strategy and vision easy to understand and lightweight Presenting to senior leadership How to explain team constraints to stakeholders outside team Planning rewrites and migrations Identifying bottlenecks through systems thinking Building relationships with stakeholders Execution: reducing friction and improving outcomes # Running good migrations and making them cheap Ways to introduce processes that others might adopt Using systems thinking to manage change at the team and individual level Alternatives # The book appears to be a collection of individual writings by the author, with the original draft forms of the content being published on Will Larson\u0026rsquo;s blog:\nhttps://lethain.com/systems-thinking/ https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/ systems survive one magnitude of growth, then need to be reimplemented dealing with a never-ending stream of migrations what do when our systems are slowing us down, but we have too many migrations https://lethain.com/migrations/ tips for running good migrations and making them successful de-risk, enable, finish purpose-built monitoring shadowing and reverse shadowing traffic migrations always take longer than planned due to the long tail being a lot more complicated good vs bad migrations - the productivity killer is when you have poor migrations following rewrites why migrations matter usually the only available avenue to make meaningful process on technical debt making technical migrations cheap https://lethain.com/presenting-to-executives/ presenting to senior leadership https://lethain.com/strategies-visions/ guides to writing durable visions and easy to understand, lightweight strategies https://lethain.com/model-document-share/ approach to introducing processes that others might adopt https://lethain.com/saying-no/ explaining team constraints to people outside the team handling disagreements on velocity and prioritisation https://lethain.com/first-team/ building relationships with stakeholders and similar grades https://lethain.com/doing-it-harder-and-hero-programming/ working harder as a solution just leads to burnout resetting broken systems rather than working harder https://lethain.com/roles-over-rocket-ships/ why tenure is a weak predictor of personal growth working at a high-growth company doesn\u0026rsquo;t you mean you get to grow quickly tracking career transitions and plateaus https://lethain.com/hiring-funnel/ identifying bottlenecks via systems thinking Conclusion # There are a number of areas of interest, not all are within the responsibilities of my current role however.\nIntended more for management rather than staff engineer Being able to consider management\u0026rsquo;s viewpoints in daily operations would be useful Potentially upcoming architecture decisions to be made that would benefit from the writings on strategy and execution Intended as a reference book, rather than a \u0026ldquo;reading\u0026rdquo; book implies longer term value as a resource to refer back to for specific questions Book is Â£20 so a reasonable calculated risk Seems \u0026ldquo;fashionable\u0026rdquo; in the software engineering space, so the work library would probably accept the book if I didn\u0026rsquo;t find enough value to warrant keeping it Outcome: Purchase later (hesitantly optimistic)\n","date":"29 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/an-elegant-puzzle-prepurchase-review/","section":"Posts","summary":"Summary # A review of my perception of \u0026ldquo;An Elegant Puzzle\u0026rdquo; by Will Larson.","title":"An Elegant Puzzle Prepurchase Review"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Mat Brunt's Blog","summary":"","title":"Mat Brunt's Blog"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"Summary # A look at the questions and known personal biases I consider when contemplating acquiring a book. These are mainly directed at physical books but a lot of the considerations apply equally to electronic formats.\nWhy Bother? # Purchasing and reading books involves numerous expenses: monetary, temporal and spatial.\nMoney is a renewable resource, you can generate more of it Time is a finite resource, once consumed it is gone Space is an awareness of extended trade-offs is there physical capacity what impact does it have on your concentration environment (e.g. clutter vs organisational costs) does an additional source of reference reduce your ability to find existing knowledge It can be helpful to identify your intended usage of the content; there is a difference between passive consumption as a distraction mechanism, and deliberate reading to form new thoughts and ideas, linking them to existing knowledge, and generating new source material to build upon when considering a scenario.\nQuestions To Consider # What areas of the book do I find particularly interesting? Can I apply knowledge from the book to any particular problems? Do I expect to get longer term value from this book, or is it \u0026ldquo;one and done\u0026rdquo; consumption? How expensive does the cost feel in the event I don\u0026rsquo;t find it useful for the long term? Is it an \u0026ldquo;ornamental\u0026rdquo; piece, and do I have the storage space for it? Is it something that can be easily passed on to someone else if I don\u0026rsquo;t find it useful? Am I convinced of the ROI? (value I expect to extract vs cost of purchase) Could this be the right book, but the wrong moment? (should I consider it later) Known Biases # Books have always been a personal reward mechanism I use my library as a distraction, when I need to quiet my mind I randomly peruse my bookshelves, reading short sections from whatever triggers my interest I am predisposed towards hoarding and organising I derive pleasure from printed books on my shelves visually from owning a \u0026ldquo;collection\u0026rdquo; tactile sensations of holding a book, feeling the pages, seeing the text and annotations made over the years most of my books are second-hand, they all have a \u0026ldquo;history\u0026rdquo; Conclusion # By answering these questions I examine my motivations:\nwhy I want to own a book what I expect to get from reading it whether I want it for vain reasons do I expect the investment to deliver any value to me is this a requirement now, or a nice to have later Ultimately, it should leave you with a feeling as to whether there is a clear purpose and use of owning another book, or is it just delivering a short-lived dopamine hit.\n","date":"29 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/book-prepurchase-review-process/","section":"Posts","summary":"Summary # A look at the questions and known personal biases I consider when contemplating acquiring a book.","title":"Book Prepurchase Review Process"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
